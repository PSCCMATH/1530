      <h2>Unit 3 Normal Distributions and Confidence Intervals</h2>

<h3>5.1 Introduction to Normal Distributions and the Standard Normal Distribution</h3>     

<h3>Overview of the Chapter</h3>

<p>“If a variable can take on any value between two specified values, it is called a <b>continuous variable;</b> otherwise, it is called a <b>discrete variable.</b>  Some examples will clarify the difference between discrete and continuous variables.</p>

<ul>

<li>Suppose the fire department mandates that all fire fighters must weigh between 150 and 250 pounds. The weight of a fire fighter would be an example of a continuous variable; since a fire fighter's weight could take on any value between 150 and 250 pounds. </li>

<li>Suppose we flip a coin and count the number of heads. The number of heads could be any integer value between 0 and infinity. However, it could not be any number between 0 and infinity. We could not, for example, get 2.5 heads. Therefore, the number of heads must be a discrete variable.</li>

</ul>

<p>Just like variables, probability distributions can be classified as discrete or continuous.  A continuous probability distribution differs from a discrete probability distribution in several ways.

</p>

<ul>

<li>The probability that a continuous random variable will assume a particular value is zero.</li>

<li>As a result, a continuous probability distribution cannot be expressed in tabular form.</li>

<li>Instead, an equation or formula is used to describe a continuous probability distribution.

</li>

</ul>

<p>Most often, the equation used to describe a continuous probability distribution is called a <b>probability density function.</b> Sometimes, it is referred to as a <b>density function,</b> a <b>PDF,</b> or a <b>pdf.</b> For a continuous probability distribution, the density function has the following properties:

</p>

<ul>

<li>Since the continuous random variable is defined over a continuous range of values (called the <b>domain</b> of the variable), the graph of the density function will also be continuous over that range.</li>

<li>The area bounded by the curve of the density function and the x-axis is equal to 1, when computed over the domain of the variable.</li>

<li>The probability that a random variable assumes a value between a and b is equal to the area under the density function bounded by a and b.”</li>

</ul>

<h3>Three Normal Distributions We Will Use in this Chapter</h3>

<h5>Standard Normal Bell Curve:  a distribution of z-scores</h5>

<p>\(\sim \mathbf{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1})\)</p>

<p> This is a standardized normal bell curve and is a distribution of z scores.  The distribution of z-scores always has the same mean and standard deviation.</p>

<img src="images/u3s1intro1.png" alt="A normal bell curve with the mean at the highest point of the bell. The mean is equal to 0 and the standard deviation is 1. ">
<br>
<br>
<h5>Normal Bell Curve:  a distribution of individual values	</h5>

<p>\(\sim \mathbf{N}(\mu, \sigma) \quad z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\)</p>

<p>This is a normal bell curve and is a distribution of individual x values which are measures for each member of the population.  The mean and standard deviation will vary for each population.</p>

<img src="images/u3s1intro2.png" alt="A normal bell curve with the mean at the highes point of the bell. The mean and standard deviation will vary for different populations, but the curve is a normal bell and the mean is the highest point on the curve.">
<br>
<br>
<h5>Central Limit Theorem Normal Bell Curve: a distribution of sample means</h5>

<p>\(\sim \mathbf{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \quad z_{x}=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu}{\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}\)</p>

<img src="images/u3s1intro3.png" alt="A normal bell curve with the mean at the highes point of the bell. The curve is narrow and taller since it represents the sample means, so a smaller number of values in the data set.">
<br>
<p>Requirements for CLT:	 </p>
<p><i>Sample is from <b>normally distributed population</b> OR Sample size is greater than 30 ( n > 30 )</i></p>
<p style="page-break-before: always"></p>
<h4>Properties of a Normal Distribution</h4>
<p>In this chapter, you will begin to study the most important continuous probability distribution in statistics: The Normal Distribution.  In the previous chapter, discrete distributions could be graphed with a histogram.  For continuous probability distributions, we will use a probability density function.</p>

<h5>Probability density curve for a normal distribution:</h5>
<ul>

<li>The mean, median and mode are equal.</li>
<li>The normal curve is bell shaped and is symmetric about the mean.</li>
<li>The total area underneath the curve is equal to 1.</li>
<li>The normal curve approaches, but never touches, the x-axis as it extends away from the mean.</li>
<li>Between z=-1 and z=1, the graph curves downward.  Everywhere else, the graph curves upward.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Empirical Rule Review</h5>
<ol>

The distribution of the height of American women can be described by a normal curve with a mean \(\mu=63.8\) inches and a standard deviation \(\sigma=4.2\) inches.  The distribution for men has a mean \(\mu=69.4\) inches and a standard deviation \(\sigma=4.7\) inches.
